# Real-time Artificial Intelligence (AI) for UAV Object Detection :
This project focuses on implementing a real-time Artificial Intelligence (AI) system for detecting drones using camera feeds.
The primary objective is to develop advanced computer vision algorithms to identify and track drones in real-time.
The system will leverage deep learning techniques for robust and accurate drone detection, allowing for security, privacy, and airspace monitoring applications.

This project is under the supervision of Dr. Ali Hilal, and Dr. Maher Al-Baghdadi,l. saif ali 

# code 
This Python code is dedicated to detecting the presence of drones. It includes some libraries that must be downloaded before executing the code
